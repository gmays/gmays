# Hi, I’m Gabe 👋

I love building AI native products.

## Now

I’m building **[AlignTrue](https://aligntrue.ai)**, the system of record for AI. Models commoditize, trust doesn’t.

## Previously

- **Director of Product @ GoDaddy** – grew WordPress product line to $100M+ ARR in 5 years, working with distributed eng teams on tools used by millions
- **Startup founder** – multiple products across SaaS & marketing tools
- **US Marine Corps Captain** – 8 years active duty, 2 years in Iraq & Afghanistan operating on small embedded teams
- **Overeducated** - BA, MS, MBA

## About me

- Product leader, builder & [investor](https://gmays.com/investing/).  
- Studying [math daily](https://gmays.com/how-im-relearning-math-as-an-adult/) since Oct 2023 to go deeper on how modern ML actually works.  
- Dad of 2, married 17 years ❤️
