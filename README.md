# Hi, I’m Gabe 👋

I love building AI native products.

## Now

I’m building **[AlignTrue](https://aligntrue.ai)**, the system of record for AI. Models commoditize, trust doesn’t.

## Why
### TL;DR

- **AI without receipts is a liability:** If you can’t prove what it saw, why it decided, and what it did, you can’t trust it in production. Receipts turn “vibes” into accountability.
- **Behavior drift is a death spiral:** Agents copy inconsistency at machine speed across tools, teams, and time. A single system of record keeps behavior coherent and governable.
- **If you can’t replay it, you can’t run it:** Real operations require auditability, rollback, and deterministic recovery. Rebuildable history turns AI work into software.

AlignTrue is how we make AI trustworthy enough to run real workflows, not just write pretty text.
