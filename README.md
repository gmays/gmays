# Hi, I’m Gabe 👋

I love building AI native products.

## Now

I’m building **[AlignTrue](https://aligntrue.ai)**, an OSS CLI to sync + manage AI directives (rules, skills, behaviors) across agents, projects & teams.

### Why

- **No more ICs:** Most "ICs" will spend more time managing agents than writing raw code. *Everyone is a manager now.*
- **Unlock GDP:** Future GDP is constrained more by *bad AI usage* than by bad models. *Make 'doing it right' easy.*
- **Level up humanity:** Clear rules for agents also make human collaboration saner & faster. *Aligned goals & priorities*

AlignTrue is my attempt to fix that binding constraint so we can actually scale with AI instead of fighting it.
